# iOS App Reviews Extractor

Unlike Google Play Store (Android), iTunes Connect or App Store Analytics does not provide an option to download user reviews related to a particular app. But Apple provides xml/json feed of App Reviews which can be parsed to get user reviews. This R Code extracts most recent iOS/iTunes App Reviews (for any iOS App) and writes an Excel CSV with those reviews.

How to use the code?

* Install R & R-Studio to exeucte the code https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
* Download [iOS-App-Reviews-Extractor.R ](https://github.com/amrrs/iOS-App-Reviews-Extractor/blob/master/iOS-App-Reviews-Extractor.R) R code
* Update your desired working directory and app_id 
* Run the code (that saves the final Excel CSV with list of reviews along with Ratings and Date in your working directory)

Feel free to suggest changes!
